This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the package installation command:

```bash
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`react-use-websocket`](https://github.com/robtaussig/react-use-websocket) to receive constant updates sent from the server.

For state managment [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/usage/nextjs).

I use Prettier Formatter to foramt the code to kame it clean.
